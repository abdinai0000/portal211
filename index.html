       <p>Hello, my name is Naima Abdi. I am in the Year Up workforce program that specializes in software testing and app development, and in this program, I've formed and attuned my technical, and interpersonal skills and gained insight into current industry needs. There's a quote by Cicero, about criticizing through creation, not by finding fault. It's solutions first with me! I am looking forward to applying this to my professional career in user experience. I want to facilitate and support the process of product to consumer and I hope to have the chance to do so within your company! </p>
